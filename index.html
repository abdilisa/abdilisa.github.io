		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a tech marketer and rising telehealth entrepreneur, living in Seattle, WA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development after <a href="http://www.sheplusplus.com">She++</a> inspired me to learn how to code.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as an independent web designer for early-stage start-ups looking for help with their prototypes, because I like to work with ambitious, creative rockstars dedicated to making a meaningful difference for their customers.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Product Marketing Manager</strong>, Microsoft Consumer Apps & Services

				<li><strong>Marketing Manager</strong>, Bling Nation
					<br><em>Palo Alto, CA, June 2010 - May 2011 </em></li>
				</li>

			</ul>
		</p>
